# ipCidrCheck

This program checks if an IP address is in a CIDR range. It can be helpful if you need to check a large list of IP addresses against CIDR ranges, such as when you need to block the IP addresses that aren't already in blocked CIDR ranges.

Licensing note: This program uses the IPAddressRange library.
